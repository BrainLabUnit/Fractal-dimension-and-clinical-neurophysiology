## Key Figures

### 1. **Comparison of FD Estimation Methods (Generated by `main_Comparative.py`)**

This figure compares various FD estimation methods across multiple signal types (STS).  
- **Dashed Black Line:** Represents the ideal scenario where estimated FD matches theoretical FD (\(FD_{th}\)).  
- **Gray Area:** Highlights the typical FD range (1 to 2) for time series.  
- **Extended Axis Limits:** Visualize methods exceeding this range.  

The results include methods like **sPSD, DFA, HE, HFD, and KFD** applied to **WCF, TLF, fBm, and fGn**.

### 2. **Understanding Higuchi’s Method (Generated by `main_Higuchi.py`)**

Figures illustrate the step-by-step process of **Higuchi’s FD method**, offering an intuitive understanding of its application and significance.
